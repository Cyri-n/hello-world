# hello-world
first time

Really considering a career path into web development (probably back end) so here's me making a github account;
Code is kinda fun but god do I need better typing skills;
I also like music so maybe there's a way to merge that and coding together - maybe some sort of software thing idk I don't have nany real ideas about it yet;
I just want to get a job that pays well enough to support my mom and it seems coding is a skillset I can capitalize on;
